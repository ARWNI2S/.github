The video game industry has developed around recognized computer technologies, such as digital imaging, sound and simulation. However, the application of certain gaming concepts to the digital platform has resulted in a vague approach. This is the case of role-playing video games, and more specifically MMORPGs, which result in a product very far from the original tabletop game format. This differentiation has been justified in many ways by the authors of the different titles.

If we analyze tabletop role-playing games from a computer application point of view, we are faced with the need to propose an integral framework for the simulation of the dynamics that occur in these role-playing games.

In tabletop role-playing games, all the dynamics of the game are related to the development of a multiform story, whose protagonists are the characters that the players control. From this point of view, the rules of the game are flexible and can be adapted to the drama of the story. On the other hand, role-playing video games have evolved in different ways, mostly favoring stat-based combat systems, and relegating the game's story to the background.

We can show that the difference between tabletop role-playing games and role-playing video games is due to flaws in the analysis of game systems, and a random use of available technologies in time.

If you want to know more about this framework for MMORPGs based on interactive digital storytelling and complex systems you can read the [NI2S whitepaper](https://github.com/ARWNI2S/NI2S-Documentation/blob/main/pub/Whitepaper.pdf), or the 100+ pages [NI2S analysis document](https://github.com/ARWNI2S/NI2S-Documentation/blob/main/pub/NI2S_full.es.pdf), only available in spanish by now.

The project is at a fairly advanced stage of development, although we cannot offer a complete API, the current state is in the [ARWNI2S/Narrative-Simulator](https://github.com/ARWNI2S/Narrative-Simulator) repositoriy for use as narrative simulation cluster and the [ARWNI2S/NI2S-Unreal](https://github.com/ARWNI2S/NI2S-Unreal) for use Unreal Engine as the presentation and editor layers of NI2S.

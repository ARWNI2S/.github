**Automated Game Mastering for Open World MMORPG**

The video game industry has developed around recognized computer technologies, such as digital imaging, sound and simulation. However, the application of certain gaming concepts to the digital platform has resulted in a vague approach. This is the case of role-playing video games, and more specifically MMORPGs, which result in a product very far from the original tabletop game format. This differentiation has been justified in many ways by the authors of the different titles.

We can show that the difference between tabletop role-playing games and role-playing video games is due to flaws in the analysis of game systems, and a random use of available technologies in time.

If we analyze tabletop role-playing games from a computer application point of view, we are faced with the need to propose an integral framework for the simulation of the dynamics that occur in these role-playing games.
